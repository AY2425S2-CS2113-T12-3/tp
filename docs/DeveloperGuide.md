## **Design & implementation**

This section describes some important details on how certain features in TASync are implemented.

### Command Package Structure

The `command` package contains the following sub-packages:

- `attendancelistcommands` - Handles commands related to attendance lists.
- `commandhandler` - Manages the processing and execution of various commands
- `student commands` - Implements commands specific to student-related operations
- `taskcommands` - Contains commands for managing tasks
- `tutorialcommands` - Handles tutorial-related commands


### Command Handler

#### 1. CommandParser

The `CommandParser` is responsible for breaking down user input into a **command keyword** and its corresponding **arguments**.

#### Implementation Details

- Extracts the first word as the command keyword (e.g., `addstudent`, `deletetask`) and treats the remainder as arguments.
- Trims and sanitizes input to ensure compatibility across all command handlers.
- Throws relevant exceptions if input is malformed or empty.

#### Operations

- `CommandParser.parse(String input)`
  - Parses the keyword and arguments from user input.
  - Returns both as a `ParsedInput` object to the `CommandHandler`.
  - Handles edge cases like extra whitespace and missing commands.

---

#### 2. CommandFactory

The `CommandFactory` is responsible for returning the correct command object for execution.

#### Implementation Details

- Implements the **Factory Design Pattern** to instantiate command classes without exposing their construction logic to external classes.
- Maps each supported command keyword (e.g., `addstudent`, `listtasks`, `newtutorial`) to its corresponding command class.
- Throws descriptive exceptions if an unrecognized command is provided.

#### Operations

- `CommandFactory.getCommand(String keyword)`
  - Returns a new instance of the corresponding command class that implements `Command<T>`.
  - Commands are registered in the factory using a `switch-case` or a command map for maintainability.
  - Supports all domains: `studentcommands`, `taskcommands`, `tutorialcommands`, `attendancelistcommands`, `markscommands`.

---

#### 3. CommandHandler

The `CommandHandler` orchestrates the end-to-end command processing â€” from parsing to execution.

#### Implementation Details

- Acts as the main entry point when a command is entered via CLI.
- Delegates parsing to `CommandParser`, command resolution to `CommandFactory`, and execution to the returned `Command` instance.
- Accepts relevant data structures such as `TaskList`, `TutorialClassList`, and `AttendanceFile` as input to command execution.
- Handles exception logging and displays error messages to the user if any part of the command flow fails.

#### Operations

- `CommandHandler.handleCommand(String fullInput)`
  - Calls `CommandParser` to break down the input.
  - Delegates command creation to `CommandFactory`.
  - Executes the command using the appropriate data object.
  - Displays output or error messages based on the outcome.

---

#### Benefits of the Design

- **Modular & Extensible:** Commands can be added or removed without changing the handler logic.
- **Polymorphic Execution:** All commands implement a common interface `Command<T>`, simplifying invocation logic.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Clearly separates exceptions thrown during parsing, command creation, and execution.
- **Testable:** Each component (`Parser`, `Factory`, `Handler`) can be unit tested independently.

#### Implementation Details

The `UnmarkTaskCommand` class implements the `Command<TaskList>` interface and interacts with the `TaskList` to mark a specified task as undone.

#### Operations

`UnmarkTaskCommand#execute(String parts, TaskList taskList)`

- Validates whether the provided input is a valid integer using `IntegerChecker.isInteger(parts)`.
- Converts the input to an integer and marks the corresponding task as undone using `taskList.markTaskAsUndone(taskNumber)`.
- Displays an error message if:
  - The input is not a valid task number.
  - The task number does not exist in the list.

#### 10. RenameTaskCommand

The `RenameTaskCommand` handles renaming a task. It requires a task number and the new task name.

#### Implementation Details

The `RenameTaskCommand` class implements the `Command<TaskList>` interface and interacts with the `TaskList` to rename a specified task.

#### Operations

`RenameTaskCommand#execute(String parts, TaskList taskList)`

- Parses the task number and the new task name from the user input.
- Renames the specified task in the `TaskList` using `taskList.renameTask(taskNumber, newTaskName)`.
- Displays an error message if:
  - The input is missing the task number or new task name.
  - The task number format is invalid.
  - The task number does not exist in the list.

  

## Appendix A: Product scope
### Target user profile

Our target users are teaching assistants (TAs) and tutors who manage both student-related administrative tasks and personal workload. They often handle responsibilities like tracking attendance, recording remarks, and planning tutorials, requiring an efficient way to stay organized. These users are comfortable with command-line interfaces (CLI) and prefer automation to manual data entry, seeking a tool that integrates smoothly into their workflow without the overhead of graphical applications.

### Value proposition

Teaching assistants and tutors often struggle with time-consuming administrative tasks which can be tedious and inefficient with traditional tools. Our CLI-based solution streamlines these processes, offering a fast, automated, and distraction-free way to manage academic responsibilities. By eliminating the need for GUI-based software, it enhances productivity and reduces manual effort.
